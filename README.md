# BetterBlenderCOD
A Blender (3.0/4.0+) plugin for importing/exporting XModels and XAnims

It's a continuation for the original Blender 2.7 addon by SE2Dev and CoDEmanX, forked from Marv7000 and shiversoftdev made compatible with the newest Blender API versions

This fork has dropped attach weapon support in favor of [BlenderCoDExtras](https://github.com/deshayu/BlenderCoDExtras), original code would only attach but would fail to merge
Also adds support for cosmetic bones and auto-normalizes bones with too many weights -shiversoftdev
