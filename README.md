# BetterBlenderCOD
A Blender (3.0+) plugin for importing/exporting XModels and XAnims

It's a continuation for the original Blender 2.7 addon by SE2Dev and CoDEmanX, made compatible with the newest Blender API versions

Stolen from Marv, adds support for cosmetic bones and auto-normalizes bones with too many weights
